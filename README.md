Oriented-Object Software Development Project

Additional Requirements for the project


The following changes/additions must be made to the existing set of requirements:
The system must now include the software projects that the company handles. Each project is assigned to one or more departments. Consequently, the manager(s) and some employees of each assigned department (not necessarily all employees in the department) will be associated with the project. The cumulative cost of the project must be maintained in the system. This includes the sum of salaries of all employees assigned to this project and other costs. For simplicity, you can assume that 'other costs' is given as one single amount. An administrator should be able to generate a report on each project which should display the people associated with the project and the total cost. 
Please note: each project is associated with a time period as well, indicating the development length for this software project. 

Due date: May 6th
